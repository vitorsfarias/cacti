----[ Installation ]

    Apply this patch to a freshly installed cacti installation, before configuring Cacti
    If you use this patch with a RPM distribution, instead of from source, then you may
    encounter errors with the patching (most likely in global.php).  If so, then please use
    the already patched files that are included with this.

    Drop the patch into your cacti directory, and then use this command on unix
    to patch your cacti files.

    patch -p1 -N < cacti-plugin-0.8.7g-PA-v2.8.diff

    Edit your includes/global.php and add a plugin to the $plugins list

    Then you will need to import the pa.sql file into your mysql database.
